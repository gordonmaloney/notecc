      <h1>Tenant Complaints Portal</h1>
      <p>
        Edinburgh City Council has a series of legal responsibilities to enforce
        good practice in the Private Rented Sector, that they are routinely not
        fulfilling. They must ensure your home meets the{" "}
        <Link to="./tolerable">Tolerable Standard</Link>, and they must ensure
        that landlords pass the{" "}
        <Link to="./fpp"> 'Fit and Proper Person' test</Link>. However,{" "}
        <strong>
          getting help from the Council couldn't be more difficult.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a tenant to make a complaint against their landlord is already
        intimidating enough, but the Council makes it about as hard as possible
        for tenants to even get in touch.{" "}
        <strong>That's why Living Rent built this site.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the council won't tell tenants who to contact when they need
        support with their landlord, <strong>we will</strong>. And, Councillors,
        this page should be a part of your own website. We'll gladly give you
        the code. You know how to get in touch.
