      <h1>The Council has all the powers it needs</h1>

      <p>
        But you wouldn't know it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite a wide range of powers, tools and even statutory obligations,
        the City of Edinburgh Council acts as though there's nothing they can -
        or are required to - do about rogue landlords in our city.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>That is nonsense.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Below are just some of the powers the Council has to take action.
